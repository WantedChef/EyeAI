# EyeAI — Project Overview

## 1. Ambition

> **Create a fully autonomous Minecraft Paper 1.20.6 world**  
> Every element — **terrain, biomes, structures, rules, quests, emergent events** — is generated, curated, and evolved by AI.  
> Players drop into an ever-changing simulation powered by a **collective of reinforcement-learned agents (“FakePlayers”)** that craft stories, wage wars, form alliances, fall in love, betray, and reshape the landscape — **all without manual scripting**.

## 3. Additional AI Systems

- **World-Scale Event Engine**  
  AI “dungeon master” triggers continent-wide calamities: plagues, eclipses, invasions, and custom boss raids with ML-driven tactics.

- **Fully AI-Trained Agents**  
  FakePlayers learn via Multi-Agent RL & Policy Gradient. _No human-authored behaviour trees in production._

- **Next-Gen Anti-Cheat**  
  Behavioral anomaly detection models flag impossible moves, dupes, or chatbots using an unprecedented gameplay dataset.

## 4. Technical Pillars

- `MLManager` orchestrates on-server inference, hot-swapping model snapshots.
- `FakePlayer` implements Bukkit’s `Player` interface so agents act as true in-game citizens.
- **Mem0Service** provides low-latency REST & bulk-batch access to cloud memory.
- **LRU caches** keep P95 memory lookups under _2ms_ at peak 500 ops/s.
- Behavior-mod kernels are compiled with Project Panama & Graal for JNI-free speed.

## 5. Data Lifecycle

1. **Simulation telemetry** → Mem0 (visualizable in the Playground)
2. **Offline training jobs** consume Mem0 dumps to improve policies
3. **Evaluation cluster** benchmarks new models before live rollout
4. Option for a “life simulator” mode — play as a single NPC with emergent sandbox goals

---

## 6. End-Game Vision

> An **endless, self-writing RPG**:  
> AI authors the narrative and players become participants in a living, breathing experiment of emergence, ethics, chaos, and wonder.
