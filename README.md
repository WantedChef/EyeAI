1. Ambition
-----------
Build a fully autonomous Minecraft Paper 1.20.6 world where *every* element—terrain, 
biomes, structures, rules, quests, and emergent events—is generated, curated and 
evolved by AI.  Players drop into an ever-changing living simulation guided by a 
collective of reinforcement-learned agents (“FakePlayers”) that craft stories, wage 
wars, broker alliances, fall in love, betray, and reshape the landscape without any
manual scripting.

2. Mem0-Powered Systems
-----------------------
• Dynamic Questlines – Mem0 memory graphs track each player’s past choices; NPC Directors spin personalised, branching missions.
• Emotion-Driven NPC Dialogue – Sentiment analysis combined with Mem0 recall for long-term context yields nuanced conversations.
• Cross-World Travel Diary – Agents maintain Mem0 timelines of visited biomes & monuments, unlocking achievements and travel quests.
• Lore Archivist – An autonomous historian NPC records world events and curates holographic exhibitions; all indexed in Mem0 and viewable via the Playground site.
• Social Circle Detection – Graph algorithms over Mem0 data infer friend groups, rival factions and lone wolves for targeted quests.
• Trust & Reputation System – Every trade, heal or ambush updates Mem0 scores influencing prices, guard hostility and guild invites.

3. Additional AI Systems
------------------------
• World-Scale Event Engine – AI dungeon-master triggers continent-wide calamities: plagues, eclipses, invasions, custom boss raids with ML-driven tactics.
• Fully AI-Trained Agents – FakePlayers learn via Multi-Agent RL & Policy Gradient curricula; no human-authored behaviour trees in production.
• Next-Gen Anti-Cheat – Behavioural anomaly detection models flag impossible moves, dupes or chatbots using the unprecedented dataset.

4. Technical Pillars
--------------------
• `MLManager` orchestrates on-server inference, hot-swapping model snapshots.
• `FakePlayer` implements Bukkit’s `Player` interface, letting agents interact as 
  first-class citizens.
• Mem0Service will  provides low-latency REST & bulk-batch pipes to cloud memory.
• LRU caches keep P95 memory lookups <2ms during peak 500 ops/s.
• Behavior-mod kernels compiled with Project Panama & Graal for JNI-free speed.

5. Data Lifecycle
-----------------
1. Simulation telemetry → Mem0 (Playground can visualise timelines)
2. Offline training jobs consume Mem0 dumps to improve policies
3. Continuous evaluation cluster benchmarks new models before live rollout
4. can make it like a game that you play as 1 npc character like life simulator game

6. End-Game Vision
------------------
An endless, self-writing RPG where AI authors the narrative; players become actors
within a living, breathing experiment of emergence, ethics, chaos and wonder.
