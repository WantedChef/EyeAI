EyeAI – AI-GENERATED MINECRAFT WORLD SIMULATOR (VISION STATEMENT)
================================================================================

1. Ambition
-----------
Build a fully autonomous Minecraft Paper 1.20.6 world where *every* element—terrain, 
biomes, structures, rules, quests, and emergent events—is generated, curated and 
evolved by AI.  Players drop into an ever-changing living simulation guided by a 
collective of reinforcement-learned agents (“FakePlayers”) that craft stories, wage 
wars, broker alliances, fall in love, betray, and reshape the landscape without any
manual scripting.

2. Mem0-Powered Systems
-----------------------
• Dynamic Questlines – Mem0 memory graphs track each player’s past choices; NPC Directors spin personalised, branching missions.
• Emotion-Driven NPC Dialogue – Sentiment analysis combined with Mem0 recall for long-term context yields nuanced conversations.
• Cross-World Travel Diary – Agents maintain Mem0 timelines of visited biomes & monuments, unlocking achievements and travel quests.
• Lore Archivist – An autonomous historian NPC records world events and curates holographic exhibitions; all indexed in Mem0 and viewable via the Playground site.
• Social Circle Detection – Graph algorithms over Mem0 data infer friend groups, rival factions and lone wolves for targeted quests.
• Trust & Reputation System – Every trade, heal or ambush updates Mem0 scores influencing prices, guard hostility and guild invites.

3. Additional AI Systems
------------------------
• World-Scale Event Engine – AI dungeon-master triggers continent-wide calamities: plagues, eclipses, invasions, custom boss raids with ML-driven tactics.
• Fully AI-Trained Agents – FakePlayers learn via Multi-Agent RL & Policy Gradient curricula; no human-authored behaviour trees in production.
• Next-Gen Anti-Cheat – Behavioural anomaly detection models flag impossible moves, dupes or chatbots using the unprecedented dataset.

4. Technical Pillars
--------------------
• `MLManager` orchestrates on-server inference, hot-swapping model snapshots.
• `FakePlayer` implements Bukkit’s `Player` interface, letting agents interact as 
  first-class citizens.
• Mem0 Service — planned: will provide low-latency REST and bulk-batch pipes to cloud memory.
• LRU caches keep P95 memory lookups <2ms during peak 500 ops/s.
• Behavior-mod kernels compiled with Project Panama & Graal for JNI-free speed.

5. Data Lifecycle
-----------------
1. Simulation telemetry → Mem0 (Playground can visualise timelines)
2. Offline training jobs consume Mem0 dumps to improve policies
3. Continuous evaluation cluster benchmarks new models before live rollout
4. Single-NPC Life-Sim mode: optionally let a player inhabit one NPC character for a life-simulator experience

6. End-Game Vision
------------------
An endless, self-writing RPG where AI authors the narrative; players become actors
within a living, breathing experiment of emergence, ethics, chaos and wonder.

7. Implementation Notes (as of 2025-08-27)
------------------------------------------
• Present in repo:
  – MLManager (src/main/java/chef/sheesh/eyeAI/core/ml/MLManager.java)
  – FakePlayer systems (e.g., ai/fakeplayer/*, core/sim/FakePlayerEngine.java)
• Missing/planned:
  – Mem0 Service implementation not yet present; introduce an interface and REST client stubs before wiring advanced features.
• Immediate next steps (MVP):
  1) Define a Mem0Service interface + config (endpoints, timeouts, auth) with no-op/local adapter for offline mode.
  2) Expose MLManager hot-swap hooks and snapshot directory watching; add metrics for swap latency and inference errors.
  3) Stand up a minimal questline engine backed by a local memory store; later swap to Mem0.
  4) Add LRU cache utility around memory lookups with P95/P99 gauges.
• Risks/assumptions:
  – Offline training pipeline and evaluation cluster are external to the plugin release.
  – Anti-cheat ML requires sufficient telemetry and labeling; ship detectors in shadow/off mode first.
